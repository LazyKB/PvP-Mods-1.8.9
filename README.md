Hello! This is a repository for links to the best places to get PvP mods for 1.8.9
If you have any problem and need to reach me I'd suggest joining my Discord server.(https://discord.gg/p8vKTvpmkG) You can also of course leave an issue if you wish.
If you want to add a mod to this list you can make a pull request. Just make sure your PR is in the same format as all the other entries. I appreciate your help!

FAQ:
1. Q: Why don't you have the downloads/jar files to the mods themselves?
   A: This is called mod redistributing, which is frowned upon, and since their source is not on here there is no way to verify that it isn't malware. Lastly on Curseforge the mod creators will get a small amount of income for people downloading their mods, and if you were to download it from here instead of there I would be taking that away from the mod makers. So sorry about the 3 extra clicks.
